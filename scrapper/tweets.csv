6,2019-12-30 23:00:08+00:00,elonmusk,"@John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Many ways to solve this problem, but the power requirements are much higher than aircraft control surfaces. When moving giant body flaps rapidly, achieving high power is much harder than high torque."
7,2019-12-30 22:44:02+00:00,elonmusk,"@ShaneAppleton7 @Erdayastronaut Building prototypes is relatively easy, volume production is hard"

19,2019-12-30 08:03:12+00:00,elonmusk,@Erdayastronaut Yes
20,2019-12-30 08:02:18+00:00,elonmusk,"@cleantechnica Also, I hate deeply nested classes in C++. Had to be said."
21,2019-12-30 08:00:14+00:00,elonmusk,"@cleantechnica The less code, the better! 1 point for adding a line of code, but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil."

25,2019-12-30 07:38:38+00:00,elonmusk,@ajtourville @Erdayastronaut Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels &amp; domes?
26,2019-12-30 07:32:50+00:00,elonmusk,@Kristennetten @SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut We‚Äôre focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon

28,2019-12-30 07:17:20+00:00,elonmusk,"@SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool."
29,2019-12-30 07:09:23+00:00,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor"
30,2019-12-30 07:04:28+00:00,elonmusk,@teslaownersSV @TonyCrisostomo @Erdayastronaut Yeah
31,2019-12-30 07:01:44+00:00,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020."
32,2019-12-30 06:57:24+00:00,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction."
33,2019-12-30 06:46:51+00:00,elonmusk,"@DJSnM We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome."

58,2019-12-29 11:23:01+00:00,elonmusk,"@JonAttenborough @cFidd Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them."

60,2019-12-29 11:09:56+00:00,elonmusk,@Snipergen @Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.
61,2019-12-29 11:03:51+00:00,elonmusk,"@cFidd No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it‚Äôs getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying.

62,2019-12-29 10:27:04+00:00,elonmusk,"@RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley That might have something to do with it. ‚ÄúStalin: Court of the Red Tsar‚Äù was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading.

63,2019-12-29 10:08:01+00:00,elonmusk,"@EvaFoxU @amargosavalley For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net."
